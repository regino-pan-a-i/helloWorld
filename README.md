# Overview

Welcome! This is my first attempt of learning how to set up a github portfolio and code in a new programming language.

This is a simple input-getter "Hello World" software written in Java.

Through this software I am trying to understand the basics of programming in Java, including any similarities between the languages I know, the syntax, and the different concepts that I need to learn.

Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.
